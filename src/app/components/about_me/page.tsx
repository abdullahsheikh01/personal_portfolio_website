            Hello! My name is Abdullah Shaikh, and I&#39;m a web developer with a strong foundation in front-end 
            technologies. I have solid skills in HTML and CSS, and I use JavaScript to make websites and 
            web applications interactive and engaging. Currently, I&#39;m learning Tailwind CSS and JSX to make my 
            designs even more responsive and efficient.
            I&#39;m also exploring the Next.js framework, which allows me to create powerful and dynamic web applications. I stay updated with the latest design and development trends and continuously work to upgrade my skills.
            I&#39;m passionate about web development and always ready to learn and implement new things. Feel free to explore my projects and skills to see how I bring creative and efficient solutions to life!
